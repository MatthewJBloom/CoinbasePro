lets make a coinbase pro api integration

goals:
1. integrate with coinbase pro api
2. practice writing unit tests
3. practice websocket feed

ideas:
* custom & default alerts for price changes (Win 10 notification?)
* chart trades locally
* rebuild api integration as a node.js server, then have python apps query it
